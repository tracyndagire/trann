		<p>This is the health organisation that helps sick people to get some medications with the doctors attention and supervision this has been succesful due to the committement of the medical personnels and it has eventually saved alot of peoples lives including those f the infants in various places more so in the villages and rurla areas that have got poor medication and this due to lack of enough health facilities and also involves moving long distances to go to th available medical centers.</p>
  <p>the red cross society has improved on the health status of most peeople since most of them are vitcims of HIV/AIDs and this hasclaimed the lives of very many people including thos born with it and can not afford the treatment of their loved ones so the socety has helped recue those lives.</p>
